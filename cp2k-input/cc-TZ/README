This directory contains the relevant include files and a typical input file. In certain cases, the parameters were adjusted, see the actual input and output files for further information.
The files *_KIND.inc contain the definitions of the basis sets and pseudopotentials given in BASIS and POTENTIALS.
The files <FUNCTIONAL_NAME>.inc contain the definition of the different functionals in CP2K.
The geometries with their respective defininition of the unit cells and cutoff radii for the truncated Coulomb potential are found in the tarball geometries.tar.gz (probably on the next upper level).
